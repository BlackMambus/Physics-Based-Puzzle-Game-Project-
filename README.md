# Physics-Based-Puzzle-Game-Project-

A physics-based puzzle game is a genre that challenges players to solve problems by applying principles of physics like momentum, gravity, friction, buoyancy, and more. These games fuse scientific laws with clever design, creating gameplay that's equal parts mental workout and playful experiment.

ðŸ§© Core Features:

Realistic Mechanics: Objects behave based on real-world physicsâ€”ball rolls, blocks topple, ropes swing.

Creative Problem Solving: Tasks often require building contraptions, timing movements, or using tools in innovative ways.

Dynamic Environments: Players interact with changing landscapes, fluid dynamics, or collapsing structures.

Trial and Error Gameplay: Encourages experimentation to find the most effective (or delightfully chaotic) solution.
